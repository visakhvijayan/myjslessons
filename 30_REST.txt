 REST APIS
REST : Representation State Transfer
REST Determines how the API looks like. It is a set of rules that developer follows when they create their API.

Each URL is called a request while the data sent back to you is called a response.

It’s important to know that a request is made up of four things:

1. The endpoint
2. The method
3. The headers
4. The data (or body)

1 End point : 
    The endpoint (or route) is the url you request for. It follows this structure:

    root-endpoint/?

    The root-endpoint is the starting point of the API you’re requesting from

    ex: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/javascript/

    https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ is the root-endpoint and /tag/javascript is the path.

    ex: /users/:username/repos

    Any colons (:) on a path denotes a variable. You should replace these values with actual values of when you send your request.

    Query parameters give you the option to modify your request with key-value pairs. They always begin with a question mark (?). Each parameter pair is then separated with an ampersand (&), 

    ex : ?query1=value1&query2=value2

2.The Method

    The method is the type of request you send to the server. You can choose from these five types below:

    GET
    POST
    PUT
    PATCH
    DELETE

3.The Headers

    Headers are used to provide information to both the client and server. It can be used for many purposes, such as authentication and providing information about the body content.

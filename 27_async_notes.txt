Async Code
# There are a few ways to work with Async code
1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Async/Await

Ajax :  Asynchronous JS & XML
# It isn't language /framework/ library
# It is a set of web technologies to send and recieve the data from the CLIENT and SERVER asynchronously.
# Does not intefere with the current page
# JSON has replaced XML for the most part
# Make async requests in the background
# No page reload / refresh need for updating a part in the web page

        
         JS call               Xml /Http Req (XHR)
CLIENT ------------> AJAX Engine ----------------> SERVER


        HTML Response                Xml /JSON
CLIENT <------------ AJAX Engine <---------------- SERVER
